                    <p>
                        I graduated from highschool in 2023 and was immediately interested in Computer Sciences. I enrolled into Keyin College's Software Development program in January, 2024. 
                        Software Development is a skill that i am grateful for and that I utilize every day. It is rewarding, exciting, and certainly frusterating at times but there is no feeling
                        comparable to overcoming errors and obstacles and perfecting a project. 
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        I aspire to be employed in the front end development field so that I can unleash my creativity and add to my portfolio each day.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        I grew up in a rural town in the small province of Newfoundland, and I hope one day to be an inspiration to other girls and women in STEM.

                        Pro Fireworks NL is a locally owned and operated fireworks company. The owner reached out to me and a friend for the webiste production and I was grateful to have the opportunity to build a 
                        freelance portfolio. This project utilized graphic design for logos, responsive design which looks stunning on all devices and screen sizes, as well as thoroughly thought out styling to enchance 
                        user experience. I look forward to working on similar projects in the future.
